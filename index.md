## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="mica-li.jpg">

I am a fourth year undergraduate at UCSD studying pure math. In my free time I enjoy weightlifting, knitting, reading, watching movies, and going to art museums. My favorite movie is *Fury* dir. David Ayer, my favorite book is *Martyr!* by Kaveh Akbar, and my favorite painter is Caravaggio. 

You can contact me at myl010 *at* ucsd *dot* edu.

$$e^{2\pi i} = 1$$

## Research Interests
I am broadly interested in low-dimensional topology, Lie theory, and classical geometry.
