My name is Mica Li and I am a fourth year undergraduate at UCSD studying pure math. In my free time I enjoy weightlifting, knitting, reading, and watching TV shows/movies. My current favorite movie is *Dune: Part Two*, my current favorite book is *Martyr!* by Kaveh Akbar. 

## Research Interests
I am broadly interested in low-dimensional topology, Lie theory, and classical geometry.
